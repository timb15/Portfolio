# Tech-Degree-Project-6
Express Portfolio Website

Going for Exceeds Expectations grade.
1.  You can start the app with npm start.
2.  There is an error page that is displayed when a non existent route is requested.
3.  I have changed bacground colors and text colors on the whole website. Added a border to the right of the profile div, 
    and added animations to the about page.
