            | I am currently a student in the Treehouse Full Stack Developer Tech-Degree. I stumbled into the world of programming
            | as I was looking for ways to advance my current carrer as a Power Engineer. I liked it so much I have 
            | decided to make a change and pursue a career in Full Stack web development. I am a highly skilled problem solver
            | and love a good challenge. I also really enjoy learning new skills and I believe that is a valuable asset in the tech industry.
            | I am taking a certificate course in Project Management as well, and will be specializing in Agile Project Management.
            | After reviewing my portfolio, please feel free to reach out if you would like to know more!
